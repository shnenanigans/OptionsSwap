# OptionsSwap
OptionsSwap changes the settings file used in standardoptions.txt for all of your instances at once. 



The files aa.txt and rsg.txt in the data folder are examples of what you might switch between, you can edit them or add more.

Edit mcpath.txt to have the path to your MultiMC folder.

Copy standardoptions.txt from your config folder and paste it into this folder. You can name it whatever you want (mine is rsg.txt). Add whichever options files you will be swapping between as well.
